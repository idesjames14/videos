♫ My life, I am always waiting ♫
"Waiting for your love" sung by Lin Jun Jie & Jin Sha

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.230
♫ An empty pocket ♫

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.510
♫ That I want to fill my love in with ♫

4
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.770
♫ Why am I always defeated? ♫

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.270
♫ I feel really helpless ♫

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.770
♫ It doesn't matter if I am good looking ♫

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.710
♫ I really want to find it back. Really want to find it back ♫

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.370
♫ My own rhythm ♫

9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.070
♫ So for just this one time ♫

10
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.490
♫ Let me bravely say it out loud♫

11
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.450
♫ Anticipating you will eventually discover my love ♫

12
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.990
♫ No matter how many turns, it gets clearer as you get closer ♫

13
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.830
♫ Please don't go ♫

14
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.770
♫ The start of happiness is learning to let go and find love ♫

♫ Anticipating you will eventually discover my love ♫

20
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.090
♫ Everywhere, you can find my care naturally  ♫

21
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.890
♫ Your existence ♫

22
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.230
♫ I can immediately see what you're thinking ♫

23
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.990
♫ Just because of love ♫

24
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.930
♫ I guess that you have already discovered my love ♫

25
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.570
♫ No matter how many turns, it gets clearer as you get closer ♫

26

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.570
♫ The start of happiness is learning to let go and find love ♫

My Best Ex-Boyfriend

30
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.020
~ Episode 1~

31
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.520
- Are the materials prepared yet?
- They're almost done.
- Hurry up with them.

32
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.500
- Kevin, are the model's clothes prepared?
- It's all done.

33
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.720
Okay, thank you.

34
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.860
Amy, when is your boyfriend coming? Fangsi is going to get mad soon.

35
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.320
What is she angry for?

36
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.300
Today is Valentines' Day.

37
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.500
Look at the time. She should have let us off work by now.

38
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.300
- It's not like you don't know her personality.
- Of course I do.

39
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.820
Because she doesn't have a boyfriend, she wishes that everyone wouldn't have one, either.

40
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.880
Aren't you her personal assistant? Can't you help me out, please?

41
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.440
What time do you think we'll be able to go home?

42
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.100
Xiao Nai, there's a package for Fang Si.

43
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.600
Oh, coming! Amy, get your boyfriend to hurry up.

44
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.700
Fang Si hates it when models are late.

45
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.240
But he took a plane here. Maybe there was a delay in the flight or something.

46
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.800
Xiao Nai.

47
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.580
Pencil.

48
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.220
Amy, Amy, where's the pencil I asked you to sharpen?

49
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.360
I forgot about it.

50
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.120
- You… You... You forgot? How can you forget? Didn't I tell you--
- I'm sorry!

51
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.700
Hey, but that's my eyebrow pencil!

52
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:35.000
Timing & Subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki.com

53
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.480
What pencil is this?

54
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.720
Your pencil's not sharpened yet. Just use this instead for now...

55
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.080
Where's the model? Why isn't he here yet?

56
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.320
Well, Amy said the flight was delayed.

57
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.220
Hello.

58
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.340
Let's not work together then.

59
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.540
I just got off an over ten hour flight. How would be in the mood to meet that arrogant designer?

60
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.620
Hello?

61
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.960
Hello? The reception isn't good. I can't hear you.

62
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.080
Hello?

63
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.720
How about I contact other modeling agencies

64
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.440
and find someone to stand in for a while?

65
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.160
If not, what about any of our colleagues?

66
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.820
After all, it's only an advertising photoshoot today.

67
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.560
It should not--

68
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.220
Prepare the sample garments.

69
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.340
Sample garments. Now. Immediately.

70
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.680
Oh, okay.

71
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.100
Fang Si, the Tang Huang CEO is here. He even brought the contract this time.

72
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.220
Today's model is your boyfriend?

73
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.020
Oh, yes.

74
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.060
It's not his fault that the flight was delayed.

75
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.380
And today is only an advertising photoshoot. Tomorrow's show is the most important.

76
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.080
He has already landed. He'll be here soon.

77
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.860
You can tell him not to come anymore. From the airport to here, even if there isn't much traffic,

78
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.740
it'll take at least an hour.

79
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.840
But he specifically flew here for this photoshoot.

80
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.560
Anyway, it isn't his fault. We're only having an advertising photoshoot today.

81
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.480
Aren't we?

82
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.980
Don Juan - Tang Huang Fashion

83
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.860
I am confident that my life will be brilliant.

84
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.620
What are you thinking of?

85
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.600
You look so distracted.

86
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.360
What else do you think I'll be thinking of?

87
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.640
Have you missed me?

88
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.600
Are you done with your tantrums yet? I've especially made a trip here and you're still going on about  it?

89
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.340
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I really didn't see you.

90
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.560
I really didn't see you.

91
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.220
He didn't do it on purpose, either. There was no harm done, anyway. Let it go. Don't be angry.

92
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.820
I'm really sorry. I can pay for the dry cleaning.

93
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.380
You having a quarrel?

94
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.560
She's a lot to handle, isn't she?

95
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.360
What has it got to do with me?

96
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.580
Look at this scarf he was wearing. What poor taste.

97
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.800
Let it go. Today's a special day, isn't it?

98
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.140
He already got a scolding from you. His heart is...

99
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.840
Is probably bleeding now.

100
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.740
Who in this world would really die if someone left another person?

101
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:31.300
When darkness comes, even your shadow will leave you. So when you're living life, you can only depend on yourself. Does this look nice?

102
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.040
It looks okay, I guess.

103
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.260
You're laughing?

104
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.860
- How are you?
- I'm good. I'm great.

105
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.580
I'm good as long as I can see you. Here, let me do a spin for you.

106
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.700
It's best when you're back. I'm all good as long as I can see you.

107
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.820
Then I'm not angry anymore.

108
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.340
You're driving?

109
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.100
I'll drive! You drive tomorrow.

110
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.060
- Then what about the day after?
- Me.

111
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.200
Fang Si, the new contract has been drawn up.

112
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.040
- Xiao Nai, how is it?
- What do you think of this?

113
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.320
Let's go with this then.

114
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.780
Director Luo, I've said it before. I will never work with Tang Huang.

115
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.440
We're really sincere about this cooperation. Look at me, a director and yet I've made so many trips here.

116
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.100
On top of that, a small workshop like yours, being able to work with Tang Huang is a good opportunity for you, too.

117
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.920
We've already changed the terms of the contract for you. Do you want to have a look at it?

118
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.920
Are you scared?

119
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.760
What do I have to be scared of?

120
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.220
Afraid that you'll eat me up?

121
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.660
Tomorrow, Qiao Rui Si Group will be holding a joint brands audition.

122
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.940
All the fashion brands in the country will be taking part.

123
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.160
I believe Tang Huang would cherish this opportunity as well. The sample is good to go.

124
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.580
At this time, you're so insistent on working with me to acquire my brand.

125
00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.480
You're afraid that Fancy will snatch your spotlight, aren't you?

126
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.660
Fang Si, you can't say it like that.

127
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.300
I say, you newcomers really don't know the industry well.

128
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.980
I know that Qiao Rui Si Group has not accepted your application to participate.

129
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.540
So, you can have two different choices, isn't it?

130
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.020
Director Luo, I appreciate your kind gesture.

131
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.760
I'll see you at the audition tomorrow.

132
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.540
I won't send you out.

133
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.580
Xiao Nai, confirm this final draft.

134
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.100
Fang Si, my boyfriend says he'll be here now, immediately. There will be absolutely no problem.

135
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.940
Saying, "Absolutely no problem," in itself is already a problem.

136
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.520
Why not wait for ten more minutes?

137
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.900
- We're not prepared here, either.
- Send a lawyer's letter to his management agency.

138
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.000
Sue him for breaching the contract.

139
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.680
Who is she?

140
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.120
Amy, Fang Si is just saying...

141
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.820
- She won't really sue your boyfriend.
- Who knows?

142
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.880
On top of being a weekend, today's Valentines' Day, too. She can't get married and she's dragging us down, too.

143
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.240
For her own dreams, she doesn't even care about our feelings.

144
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.480
Let's not talk about it anymore. We should be preparing now.

145
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.200
Amy, let's get ready to set off soon.

146
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.320
What are you doing? You need me for an advertising photoshoot, too?

147
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.680
Princess, I'm begging you. Don't be angry.

148
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.460
Just endure her for a while.

149
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.980
I thought you opening a restaurant was just for fun.

150
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.320
Who would have thought...

151
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.620
it would be this good.

152
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.680
How is it? My capabilities are better than just endorsing Tang Huang right?

153
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.960
Looks like I've really underestimated you.

154
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.020
Anyway, what I like best is endorsing for Tang Huang.

155
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.820
And I've decided, not only in this lifetime,

156
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.340
I'll endorse Tang Huang in my next lifetime, too.

157
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.600
Please pardon me in the next lifetime.

158
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.100
What do you mean by that?

159
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:01.100
But seriously, the furniture here really does look classy.

160
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.200
That's because I listened to you. You said so yourself.

161
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.140
Life is meant to be appreciated slowly, right?

162
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.380
We need to enjoy it.

163
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.680
Then we shouldn't pass our lives as though we're in a war, should we?

164
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.000
Wait for me.

165
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.720
Fancy

166
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.860
What a weird customer. You haven't taken your medicine, right?

167
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.040
I think he has to take a lot of medicine to be able to recover.

168
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.240
So aren't you the happiest when you're with me?

169
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.900
Let's go. Dinner's ready.

170
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.140
Let me introduce this to you. This is called low-heat salmon.

171
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.920
Because you don't like things that are too dry, so I learned this cooking method.

172
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.440
It allows you to taste the freshness of the fish even though it's cooked.

173
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.540
How is it?

174
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.360
It's delicious.

175
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.780
I'm all embarrassed.

176
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.940
It's fragrant and it's tender.

177
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.160
Eat slowly.

178
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.520
Didn't you say life is meant to be appreciated slowly? You're eating so fast.

179
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.840
How do you appreciate the taste?

180
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.400
You only need to slowly taste food that doesn't taste nice,

181
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.260
because then you can slowly finish your food

182
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.760
so you can eat less of it. But this really tastes heavenly.

183
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.440
See, it's all gone now.

184
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.320
Here, more for you.

185
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.040
- Luckily you can sweet talk!
- It is delicious!

186
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.940
I told you to eat slowly. Don't choke.

187
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.260
We'll work after your meal. Come and look for me when you are done.

188
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.880
Hurry up.

189
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.720
Have you known any new girl when you were overseas?

190
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.720
Of course,

191
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.020
not.

192
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.980
You were always calling me three times a day during my meal times. Do you think I would have had the time?

193
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.800
Still giving me a black face!

194
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.160
But you haven't changed your eating habits!

195
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.600
So other habits must be even harder to change.

196
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.100
We have already been together for so many years.

197
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.800
My Lady, I have even travelled from afar to celebrate

198
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.520
Valentine's Day with you. What is there to worry about?

199
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.000
Okay.

200
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.520
Hello.

201
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.620
President Fu, I am here because of your reputation to save today's situation.

202
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.280
I won't accept anything less than $2000.

203
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.100
Bring the reflector.

204
00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:24.980
Timing & Subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki.com

205
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.440
I'm on my way there.

206
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.740
That's right. I only want to see potential brands.

207
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.700
Alright, that's it then.

208
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.040
Little girl.

209
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.380
Hold on tight to your balloon.

210
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.140
If the balloons fly off, you can't get them back

211
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.960
- so you must be careful in the future.
- Thanks, Big Brother.

212
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.140
You are welcome.

213
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.660
Then I will leave first.  You be careful.

214
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.520
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

215
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.420
Don't do that. President Fu, why aren't you taking anymore photos?

216
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.860
- What do you mean by this, President Fu? You called me over, yet you're not taking pictures anymore?
- Wait! Wait!

217
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.360
- Is there a problem?
- Do you have time?

218
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.140
I would like to ask for your help.

219
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:28.060
Help? How do I know that you are not a fraud?

220
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.040
Be my model. $3000 an hour.

221
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.620
$3000 an hour? You sound more like a fraud.

222
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.060
So you agree?

223
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.620
How is it? Can you do it?

224
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.420
I am sorry but I am not interested.

225
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.760
What is this? You got me in a hurry and now you are looking for someone else!

226
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.900
I have already told you. I will charge you once I am out of the office. So regardless, you must still pay for my time.

227
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.860
You can't even pass the advertising photoshoot, yet you still dare to ask me for money?

228
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.380
It's not bad to give $100 for your transportation cost.

229
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.400
Go ask Xiao Nai for the money, then quickly be on your way.

230
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.920
Our model has arrived.

231
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.300
Sorry I was late. So it was you!

232
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.560
Then why did President Fu bother looking for me?

233
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.140
How would I know why?

234
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.560
She always thinks too highly of herself and likes to order people around.

235
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.320
What's wrong?

236
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.330
Why did you arrive so late?

237
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.800
How about after the shoot, I will help you with your work and I will still pay you?

238
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.620
You help me with my work?

239
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.320
Are you super woman or Doraemon?

240
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.560
Sorry. I am really in a hurry.  I don't have time to play with you.

241
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.340
Listen to me.

242
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.600
You are too much!

243
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.260
If you wear that shirt, the impact will be much better.

244
00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.680
You have to believe me. I won't take up too much of your time.

245
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.340
Give it back to me.

246
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.000
I am sorry but I didn't do it deliberately.

247
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Not deliberately?!

248
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.340
Hello, Fang Si Jie (older sister)?

249
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.740
Xiao Nai, quickly drive the car over.

250
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.720
But there is a traffic jam now.

251
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.060
I don't care! Just hurry up!

252
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.000
Mister, mister.

253
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.780
Mister.

254
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.060
Lady, I am happy to meet you but I don't wish to see you again.

255
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.800
Please get out of my way. I am really in a rush.

256
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:14.020
Sorry but my assistant is a new driver and there is nothing you can do now even if you are in a rush.

257
00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.180
Why don't you help me first?  Then I can also help you.

258
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.760
Let's help each other so we don't owe each other anything.

259
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.780
Lady, I am really in a rush. Please move aside.

260
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.360
Just give me an hour.

261
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.320
Stay out of my way.

262
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.080
Sorry.

263
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.680
Photographer and yet you carry the original design drawing?

264
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.480
Photographers who can't design aren't good photographers.

265
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.300
- You are… ?
- Time is precious. Stop wasting time.

266
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.200
$3,000 an hour.  Give me your decision.

267
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.440
Tiramisu in Italian means,

268
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.780
"Take me with you."  You left for the U.S. after college.

269
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.080
I thought we would never see each other again.

270
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.360
Do you still remember three years ago?

271
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.620
I went on location in Italy.

272
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.140
Magically, we met again.

273
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:41.600
That day we had coffee and tiramisu.

274
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.760
That day was an unforgettable day.

275
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.340
We did not talk much during the four years of college.

276
00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.480
I feel that day

277
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.180
was the true start for us.

278
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.860
- Why are you so late?
- Aren't I here now?

279
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.900
You are here but they are ready to change personnel.

280
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.980
Is that so?

281
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.240
How is it? It's okay, right?

282
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.680
Let's go there.

283
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.880
They have already put on the outfit.  What am I going to shoot?

284
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.420
I informed you that it was today. It's not my fault that you're late.

285
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.840
Please make sure next time and then tell me, okay?

286
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.920
I'm going first.
-Wait, what do you mean?

287
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.820
Amy, I know you are angry right now.

288
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.280
But its not the right time to be angry. The advertising shoot is about to be published.

289
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.800
Can we finish doing the important things first?

290
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.840
What do you think Fang Si meant?

291
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.080
She ignores our handsome model but grabs a nobody off the street.

292
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.980
Even made my boyfriend come here for nothing.

293
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.700
Besides letting him go, she even threatened to sue.  Is this necessary?

294
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.700
I've worked for her for so long.  If she does not appreciate the merit of my work, she should at least consider my effort.

295
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.760
She would not even give me any consideration for something like this.

296
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.660
I know, I know, you're her assistant.

297
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.020
She should think of you, right?

298
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.360
Then, let's finish the shooting first.

299
00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.960
Okay, okay. I'll treat you to coffee. Hurry up.

300
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.680
Be more natural.  Your expression is stiff.  Your movement is more so.

301
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.660
Relax.

302
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.040
Be natural.

303
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.460
Don't smile too much. Pull back a little.

304
00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.920
Okay.

305
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.000
Keep this posture.

306
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.780
Is this okay?

307
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.480
Hey. This should be enough.

308
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.140
Are you done yet?

309
00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.780
Are you always like this?

310
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.900
This is my job.

311
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.380
I am saying… is this how you ask for favor?

312
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.780
I didn't beg you. We are just doing business.

313
00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.890
This looks better.

314
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.590
All right, come.

315
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.590
Keep the posture.

316
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.550
Don't smile too much. Pull back a little.

317
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:23.290
Your outfit is really pretty. There's not many who can pull it off like you.

318
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.190
It will become fashionable soon.

319
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.270
That may not be so.

320
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.690
Can we not chat? I didn't bring you here to chat.

321
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.760
Let's change location.

322
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.460
"I'm not here to chat."

323
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:10.020
Timing & Subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki.com

324
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.880
Can we not separate?

325
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.160
Thank you. You have worked hard.

326
00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.470
Even though you're not a very reliable photographer,

327
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.250
but I think you're a very special designer.

328
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.990
Please exclude "I think," thank you.

329
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.470
Your standard for matching clothing is so high.

330
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.750
You're not a Virgo, are you?

331
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:59.350
Our job has ended already. I won't reply to any personal questions.

332
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.590
When you're working you can't talk. When you're off work you still can't talk.

333
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.650
Have you never considered your employees' feelings?

334
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.770
Where are you going? I'll drive you there.

335
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.730
No need, it's too late anyway. I'm not in a rush anymore.

336
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:19.130
Then I'll be going. Thank you.

337
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.490
- Bye.
- Bye.

338
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.560
Sir, I haven't given you money yet.

339
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.060
No need, next time invite me for a meal.

340
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.460
There won't be another next time.

341
00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.920
Don't assume so early.

342
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.320
We are all business people. Let's take care of the money.

343
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.220
Then, thank you.

344
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:58.240
♫ Who is behind me when I am alone? ♫

345
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:04.800
♫ Do I turn left or right for my happiness? ♫

346
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:13.380
♫ If we can turn back the clock, would you give up everything for me? ♫

347
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:20.220
♫ Trembling in bliss and happiness, to exchange tenderness ♫

348
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:28.380
♫ I am willing to forget everything I own. And only to keep the memory of your eyes ♫

349
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:39.280
Your keys.
♫ I will remember the warmth of your right hand forever. ♫

350
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.980
What's wrong with her?

351
00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.860
Oh my, I didn't see anything.

352
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.720
- What are you doing?
- Hey! My painting.

353
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.160
Hang it up.

354
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.020
It's my turn now?

355
00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.520
You even know to return.

356
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.220
Why not just die overseas? How long are you staying for?

357
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.980
For two to three weeks.

358
00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.960
- So short?
- So long?

359
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.400
That is not what I meant. I meant that you could not just ignore your business overseas.

360
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.520
Isn't Tang Huang also his business?  Did he ever bother with it?

361
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.180
Okay. Okay.  Anyway, I don't understand about business.

362
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.380
You two have a good chat.

363
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.460
Sorry to disturb you.

364
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.960
Hey, you finally came back. You really want to stress me out?

365
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.660
Xiao Nai, are you leaving yet?

366
00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.100
- If you're not leaving, then I am.
- I am coming.

367
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.420
Tell me how can there be people like her?

368
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.540
She always thinks she is right, and she never cares about how others feel.

369
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.940
I am telling you this is a sickness. Only you can tolerate her.

370
00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.000
- I still have the car key.
- Don't talk to me about this.

371
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.760
If she really does not care about how others feel,

372
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.300
she could have taken the car keys and left.

373
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.160
Fang Si seems tough on the outside but actually has a sensitive heart.

374
00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.460
- It's not bad once you get used to her style.
- Why should I get used to her style?

375
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.920
Because there are people like you letting her get away with it, she does not feel the need to change.

376
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.580
To run a business herself, she can't possibly not understand how to deal with people, right?

377
00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.540
With the way she acts, who would be willing to put themselves on the line?

378
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.900
To be candid, what did we get from her?

379
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.400
With the meager salary she gives me, it's not even enough for my rent.

380
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.240
You can't say it like that.

381
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.920
Actually I feel pity for Fang Si.

382
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.220
Hypothetically speaking, I mean hypothetically.

383
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.420
If you were walking on the street by yourself on Valentine's Day

384
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:37.400
and you saw your ex-boyfriend with his current girlfriend,

385
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.520
- what would you do?
- It will depend on whether I have a desirable boyfriend now.

386
00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.520
- If I do, then I will show him off in front of them.
- What if you don't?

387
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.460
- If not, I would turn around in tears and run away at 70 miles per hour.

388
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.000
I shouldn't let my ex-boyfriend gloat, right?

389
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.060
What if the most tragic part is that the current girlfriend of your ex

390
00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.780
is your nemesis?

391
00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.420
That tragic?

392
00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:02.900
Then I would not even go outside to prevent myself from meeting them and getting mad.

393
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.400
What if the most, most tragic part is

394
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.680
that you are caught by your nemesis the moment you leave your house?

395
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.620
If I really ran into this situation...

396
00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.900
You don't know this. I was

397
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.500
really annoyed by the arrogant designer. She doesn't fall for any soft or hard tactics.

398
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.960
I wanted to eliminate the hostility but she insists on staying an enemy.

399
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.380
Not only did she refuse to sign the contract, she even insisted on exhibiting her work.

400
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.920
You tell me what I should do now.

401
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.140
Then let her do it.

402
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.720
Let her suffer a bit, then she will understand our sincerity.

403
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.320
Hey, Bro.  It is easy for you to say but this is our business.

404
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.360
With the news that Qiao Rui Si is returning from overseas to open a new firm,

405
00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.820
all the major domestic companies are forming alliances.

406
00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.460
My original plan was

407
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.780
to sign some of the famous designers for insurance.

408
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.880
Who'd have thought we would run into such a strange person?

409
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.340
It does not matter.

410
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.720
Hey, I'll be really busy, so I won't be going tomorrow.

411
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.980
You are not going again?

412
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.200
Hey bro, did you listen to too much of Yang Kun's [Chinese singer] music?  Nothing seems to matter to you.

413
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.500
I thought you came back to realize your ambition.  You returned just for vacation again.

414
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.220
Lift up your spirit. Come on.

415
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.320
If it doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter to me.  It will then not matter to both of us.

416
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.580
It doesn't matter who you fall in love with…

417
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.060
Fu Fangsi

418
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.540
Long time no see.

419
00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.500
I don't really want to see you, either.

420
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.320
But you are just like those little posters,

421
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.420
I could not avoid even if I try.

422
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.540
The PS [photoshop] expert has got some talent.

423
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.960
The person in the poster and the real person

424
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.340
are so different.

425
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.810
Do you know that I am currently with Li Tang? Isn't that surprising?

426
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:07.470
The change of topic was too rushed.  You need to improve your conversational skills.

427
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:12.840
Actually he flew almost around the world to be with me for Valentine's Day.

428
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.890
It's very tiring. Hey, Fangsi

429
00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.510
how about your boyfriend?

430
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.810
Oh. Look at me.

431
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.890
You are his ex. No, no, you

432
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:26.650
are the ex-ex-ex-ex-girlfriend.

433
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:31.770
As a matter of fact, I don't have any problem for old friends to get together and catch up.

434
00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:37.490
Let's get a drink. You have already been wandering around here the whole day, pretending to be busy just so

435
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.610
he could see you.

436
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:42.910
Who is Li Tang?

437
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:53.780
Li Tang is the CEO of Tang Huang.  He was the one to ask me to be the spokesperson for the company.

438
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.460
He loves me very much.

439
00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.400
This restaurant

440
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.480
is also his gift to me.

441
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.680
Then I should wish you early fame and fortune.

442
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.180
Right now I only care about who Qiao Rui Si is.

443
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.940
Just what do you have to compete with me?

444
00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.920
Is it your little reputation, or your inferior products?

445
00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.400
With my Fancy [her company name].

446
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.860
Please stop living in your fantasy.

447
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.240
- Can't you let go of your...
- Cheng Xiang Nan!

448
00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:28.100
We will know tomorrow whom Qiao Rui Si will select as a partner.

449
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.980
You have the mindset to hang around me here?

450
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.620
You should spend more time to learn PS.

451
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.470
Never hurts to have another skill.

452
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.650
Fu Fang Si, what are you gloating for?

453
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.860
Do you still think you are a 20-something year old little girl?

454
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.260
Tang Huang.

455
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.680
Oh.

456
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.380
Where did you go for all this time?

457
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.600
I understand that you want a world for the two of you only.

458
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.940
You didn't need to get rid of the chef.  How would the chef get in your way?

459
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.100
How many times have I told you?

460
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.560
I will pay for this. I will pay for it now, okay?

461
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.000
Don't.

462
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.940
Don't cooperate with Fu Fang Si.

463
00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.880
What are you thinking?

464
00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.560
I thought it was about something serious.

465
00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.000
I was wondering. Li Tang

466
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.520
dated many other girls and you never cared before. This ex- ex- ex--

467
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:30.710
I did not tell him. I only told him that the company wants to sign a few famous designers. Besides,

468
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.130
Li Tang has no idea how Fu Fang Si has been these past two years.

469
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.550
I am telling you the truth. If there is anything false in what I said,

470
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.830
then from now on every time I go out,

471
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.490
I won't find Wifi, okay?

472
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.730
- Everything you said is true?
- Everything is true.

473
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.830
Moreover, when did Li Tang pay any attention to business?  It's not like you don't know him.

474
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.830
He is first for happiness and second for business.

475
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:57.560
He also told me that he will definitely not go there tomorrow, so it'll be okay, right?

476
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.070
That's more like it.

477
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.290
There is something that I don't get.

478
00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.260
Why do you-- Ah!

479
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.560
Go eat by yourself.

480
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.880
Nonsense.

481
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:26.060
Timing & Subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki.com

482
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.620
Good morning.

483
00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.730
- Director Yin, good morning.
- This Director Yin is really a catch.

484
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:42.100
Not only is he handsome but he's also approachable. I should interact with him.

485
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.020
Say, you are really making your presence known.

486
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:49.160
You've barely been here for a month, yet your popularity is rising, Director Yin.

487
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.280
Good morning, Director Yin.

488
00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.620
President.

489
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.560
I heard it was you who accepted the application of Fu Fang Si's workshop,

490
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.800
permitting them to participate in the brand competition tomorrow.

491
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.020
That is right.

492
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:17.000
- I feel there is a lot of potential, and--
- No, no, no!

493
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.620
I remember you said before that you wanted to take a look at her workshop

494
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.780
before making the final decision.  But you never went.

495
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.860
Her so-called brand products are nothing more than these unproven drawings.

496
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.260
That is right.  I did not go to her workshop.

497
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.200
But I have determined that she is a designer with potential based on other evidence.

498
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.560
I think our duty is to serve as the eye for the market,

499
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.960
to identify those with the most potential, so that they can become the most successful products.

500
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.900
I will wait for your good news.

501
00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.840
He has no talent, yet he's really good at criticism.

502
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.120
Before he went to NSH many times but never came back with a deal.

503
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.560
You got the contract signed with just one visit.

504
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.820
Headquarters brought you back here with the intent of having you take his place.

505
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.560
He's got to admit that he is past his prime.

506
00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.860
This is Tang Huang, the company that Johnson has always liked.

507
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.660
Core value is strong and it has several best-selling independent brands under its name.

508
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.020
If we can be its agency, we would save time, money, and effort.

509
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:44.900
But instead, you prefer to go and dig out some unknown workshops and firms.

510
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.660
For example, this one.

511
00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.600
She grabbed you to take a few photos and you allowed her to participate in the contest.

512
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.600
You are openly going against Johnson.

513
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.820
Do you still resent what happened to you before?

514
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.640
Before?

515
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.300
I have already removed those memories from my head.

516
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.520
If I continued to live in the past,

517
00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.140
would I deserve to sit in this chair?

518
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.460
Don't be so serious.  I am just kidding.

519
00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.080
I am serious about everything.

520
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.180
The old fox has had a problem with you for quite a while.

521
00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.540
He always made things difficult for you.  He may lay a big trap for you in the future.

522
00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.700
Don't we need to prepare for something like this?

523
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.840
Then you tell me.  What are you going to do about him?

524
00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.620
Easy.

525
00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.060
Wait for his next move.

526
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:49.020

527
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.380
♫ This beginning is so sudden ♫

528
00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.460
Li Tang, have you not brought enough surprises into my life?

529
00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:06.060
♫ I wonder if the one I see is the real you ♫

530
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.340
♫ This time I ♫

531
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.660
But this time, no surprise

532
00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.180
will stop me.

533
00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.080
♫ My feeling at the moment ♫

534
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:23.100
♫ Is that I can't even recognize myself ♫

535
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:27.260
♫ But still try to persuade myself ♫

536
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:35.020
♫ It's best to let it be ♫

537
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.740
♫ Keep going ♫

538
00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.820
It's done. You can take a look.

539
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:39.620
♫ Don't know where my direction is ♫

540
00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.980
- See?
- Looks nice.

541
00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.100
Fangsi, wait until Father makes enough money, then

542
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.420
I will open a clothing store,

543
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.940
and call it Fangsi. Is that good?

544
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.860
What is the use of having a Fang Si Clothing Store?

545
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.080
In the future, Fang Si will be a clothing brand.

546
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.040
Clothing brand?

547
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.860
Hmmm.

548
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.620
Fang Si Clothing.

549
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.680
Interesting. You're better than your dad.

550
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:13.200
From now on, we will call our brand, Fang Si.

551
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.660
You can start the company.

552
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.740
♫ Don't know where my direction is ♫

553
00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.620
Even though I spent another six years,

554
00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:25.000
but now I can finally let everyone see

555
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.340
my brand, my real dream.

556
00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.260
I don't need anything else.

Timing & Subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki.com

558
00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.720
Director Luo, what kind of surprise will Tang Huang bring to this show for everybody?

559
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.280
First of all, I want to say thanks to our media friends for their continuing support.

560
00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.260
Tang Huang considers this an important event and we have prepared for it for more than half a year.

561
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.720
We have brought with us our top product line and our most modern design.

562
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.540
We believe tonight we will give everyone an overwhelming surprise.

563
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.320
I have not introduced them yet--

564
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.920
- I have not finished yet.
- This show has invited all the well-known companies.

565
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.040
You are the only workshop.  Does this mean that your design is getting special attention?

566
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.220
Before, you rejected several contracts that included a number of big clients.

567
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.340
Is it your way to declare war against your competition?

568
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.560
I have no intention of being in a war with my colleagues.

569
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.800
I only want to present my design concept through the event today.

570
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.900
Ms. Fu, what kind of design idea will you bring to your audience?

571
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.540
Pardon me.  May we talk about this after the conclusion of the fashion show, okay?

572
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.460
Sorry about that.

573
00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.540
- Ms. Fu.
- Ms. Fu

574
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.040
Ms. Fu! Ms. Fu!

575
00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.880
The show has not even begun.  She is acting as if she owns the place.

576
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.320
I can't stand her arrogant demeanor.

577
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.480
Don't worry.  We still have our secret weapon.

578
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:13.560
It's okay. Let's let her gloat a little. She definitely won't be the one to laugh at the end.

579
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.880
We rejected them before.  It appears that they may join forces against us.

580
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.180
Did you see the look on Director Luo and Director Ou's faces?

581
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.820
If looks could kill, you would have died several hundred times.

582
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.960
Don't mind them. We just worry about what we have to do. Xiao Nai, go with me to there.

583
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.280
Annie, you stay here to watch the procedural flow.

584
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.860
- Ms. Fu, your clothes have arrived.
- Come with me.

585
00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.780
Xiang Nan Jie, I brought you this.  Please take a look.

586
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.280
No matter what.  I will only wear one dress.

587
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.060
If not for Li Tang, do you think I would be here?

588
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.880
That's fine.  Whatever you wish.

589
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.560
It is unusual for Mr. Tang to come back.

590
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.380
I think the day you two tie the knot is getting closer, isn't it?

591
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.940
Our wedding will take place sooner or later.

592
00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:17.760
I just hope that the business with Tang Huang won't cause any trouble.

593
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:23.200
What kind of trouble could it be?  We have all seen how much you love Mr. Tang.

594
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.420
And we are all amazed.  You went to learn about worldwide culinary art,

595
00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.140
and also took classes to educate yourself about business management.

596
00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:35.400
I can't believe how lucky Mr. Tang is to be able to marry  Xiang Nan Jie.

597
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.280
Stop brown-nosing here.

598
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.720
None of these mean anything here.

599
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.300
You take care of work now.

600
00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.160
You are trying so hard with flattery,

601
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.660
just so you can become the premier agent through my fanfare and connections.

602
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:55.260
Xiang Nan Jie, you can't say it like that. We have worked together for so many years, and

603
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.820
have developed this rapport.

604
00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.120
Yes.  We have.

605
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:04.520
But before our interest, the rapport must yield.

606
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.620
Let's say that if one day

607
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.060
I lose my fame, background, or support,

608
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.220
would you try as hard as now in helping me?

609
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.860
Your facial expression tells me that you wouldn't.

610
00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.720
But you are an honest person

611
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.620
so don't worry.

612
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:32.340
I won't allow myself to come to a day like that.

613
00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.420
~ Preview~
It is better to never ask about certain things.

614
00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.360
That is not it.

615
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.820
It's just that I don't think that highly of you.

616
00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.060
Who do you think others will believe as a model, you

617
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.180
or me?

618
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.740
You'd better change your outfit now.

619
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.360
I want to switch places with Tang Huang.

620
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.200
Was it your arrangement?

621
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.880
If you don't want this video to appear in the inboxes of all the major media,

622
00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.220
then you'd better change your clothes and get out there.

623
00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:03.000
Will you marry me?

624
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:13.120
